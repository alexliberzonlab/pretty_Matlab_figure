Concept:

-The export_fig function purpose is just to make sure that the export (conversion) to PDF (or any other format that it support) from your MATLAB fig. will go smoothly...
 (MATLAB export functions don't work so well, especially if the fig. is complex (numerous curves and such). 
 Therefor the fig. must be "pretty" before it is exported. (see "how to use export_fig" below) 

-Tips for "pretty" fig. in matlab:

	1. use the function setdef, this function set default setting for plot functions in MATLAB, simply call the function BEFORE you plot the fig. by...
	   writing  "setdef()" in a previous line. The setdef setting are set for a double column paper, where the fig size is a single column (2 figs side by...
	   side will have a page width). (setdef was created by Erez Benjamin to meet Slava's requirement for Figs.)
	
	2. set the background color white, when fig is open, set(gcf,"color","w"), probably can incorporate this into seddef.

	3. Try to use colors that have only one non-zero value in the RGB, like [0,0,139]-this is dark blue. if you need more colors, look online for some RGB...
	   values for nice gentle-smooth colors, try not to use too bright colors (in the documentation of MAPLE they have a lot of nice ones).

	4. If you need additional markers, like zoom in view box, text box arrows etc. try to use matlab for it, make sure you work with the fig in it's original...	
	   size.

-How to use export_fig:

	1. first download and install ghostscript: http://www.ghostscript.com and  you might need also Xpdf package: http://www.xpdfreader.com  (better not the change...
	   the default locations of the installations, because than you will need to guide export_fig to its location)

	2. to export: when the fig is ready and open in matlab (at it's proper size), direct matlab to the location of export_fig, than write in the command line:
	   export_fig fig_name.pdf -painters
	   the fig. will be saved in the directory where export_fig is located, in PDF format. the -painters is the rendering option I usually use.
